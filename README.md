# database_testing in classicmodels database

The 'classicmodels' database i have used to perform various database testing was taken from [here](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/mysql-sample-database/) . This is mainly a sample database which will help you wrok with MySQL quickly and effectively.

The 'classicmodels' database is a retailer of scale models of classic cars. It contains typical business data, including information about customers, products, sales orders, sales order line items, and more.

Weâ€™ll use this sample database in our MySQL tutorials to demonstrate a wide range of MySQL features, from simple queries to complex stored procedures.
